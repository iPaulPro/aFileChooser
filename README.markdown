# aFileChooser - Android File Chooser

aFileChooser is an __Android Library Project__ that simplifies the process of presenting a file chooser.

Intents provide the ability to hook into third-party app components for content selection. This works well for media files, but if you want users to be able to select *any* file, they must have an existing File Explorer app installed. Because many Android devices don't have stock File Explorers, the developer must often instruct the user to install one, or build one, themselves. aFileChooser solves this issue.

### Features:

 * Full file explorer
 * Simplify `GET_CONTENT` Intent creation
 * Easily convert a `Uri` into a `File`
 * Determine MIME data types
 * Follows Android conventions (Fragments, Loaders, Intents, etc.)

## Installation

Add aFileChooser to your project as an [Android Library Project](http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/projects/projects-eclipse.html#ReferencingLibraryProject).

Add `FileChooserActivity` to your project's AndroidManifest.xml file with a fully-qualified `name`. The `label` and `icon` set here will be shown in the "Intent Chooser" dialog.

__Important__ `FileChooserActivity` must have the `<intent-filter>` set as follows:

    <activity
        android:name="com.ipaulpro.afilechooser.FileChooserActivity"
        android:icon="@drawable/ic_chooser"
        android:label="@string/chooser_label" >
        <intent-filter>
            <action android:name="android.intent.action.GET_CONTENT" />

            <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
            <category android:name="android.intent.category.OPENABLE" />

            <data android:mimeType="*/*" />
        </intent-filter>
    </activity>

## Usage

Use `startActivityForResult(Intent, int)` to launch the "Intent Chooser" dialog (shown below), or `FileChooserActivity` directly. `FileChooserActivity` returns the `Uri` of the file selected as the `Intent` data in `onActivityResult(int, int, Intent)`.

    private static final int REQUEST_CHOOSER = 1234;

    @Override
    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);

        Intent getContentIntent = FileUtils.createGetContentIntent();
        Intent intent = Intent.createChooser(getContentIntent, "Select a file");
        startActivityForResult(intent, REQUEST_CHOOSER);
    }

    @Override
    protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {
        switch (requestCode) {
        	case REQUEST_CHOOSER:	
            	if (resultCode == RESULT_OK) {	
                	final Uri uri = data.getData();
                	File file = FileUtils.getFile(uri);
            	}
        }
    }

A more robust example can be found in the aFileChooserExample folder.

__Note__ The `FileUtils` class provides a helper method to construct an `ACTION_GET_CONTENT` Intent (`FileUtils.createGetContentIntent()`). It also contains a method to convert a `Uri` into a `File` (`FileUtils.getFile(Uri)`).
